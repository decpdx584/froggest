Overall comments:
(some of these might be obvious, but hey, that is what this is about!)
    - Going thru and adding comments would be an easy way to show you know what you are doing
    - That being said... Your code is very clean and easy to read ðŸ˜ƒ
    - The game doesn't quite fit on my screen(vertically) a little bit of responsive css would clean up the user experience
    - P.S. I forgot how fun frogger is ðŸ˜…
    - and this s*** gets QUICK! ðŸ˜³
    - A level counter would be a nice add, maybe some high score tracking (I did this in local storage in my project 1 if you want to just take that from my repo, feel free)
    - Randomizing logs would be cool, so that each row is unique each "loop" (another stretch, not sure if it would be worth the time... But would still be cool!)
